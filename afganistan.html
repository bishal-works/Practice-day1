       <p>The United States of America is a very unique country for numerous reasons. 
        One particularly good reason is our great cultural diversity. 
        Weaved deep into our history are the tales of people traveling overseas to the New World looking for better lives. 
        Of course, not all these tales have happy endings (or happy beginnings,
         or any happiness anywhere in some cases), but regardless, learning about our nation’s migratory history is very important.
          Immigration is a very serious topic of discussion in today’s heated political climate; whatever your stance of the issue may be,
         it’s handy to have some knowledge of the subject, as it could affect your opinions on it in a substantial way.
          We should discuss where and why immigrants came to our shores, how legislators have tried to stop them, and what impact they’ve left on our country today. 
          The history of immigration to the U.S. is quite vast. Most of the early immigrants were from Europe, as they were the ones who colonized the New World in the 1500s.
           It took 2-3 months to sail across the Atlantic, and many people died due to the abhorrent conditions on the ships.
         Things got off to a troubling start, to say the least. </p>
