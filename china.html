<p>China is one of the greatest macroeconomic success stories of the current generation.
     The People’s Republic of China has in a little less than half a century moved to arguably be one of the greatest economies in the world.
      Indeed, some may even argue that it is the greatest. This, as per the Kindleberger/Minsky model, is a major cause for worry and not celebration. 
      Indeed, around the year 2015, the Chinese economy was doing so well that it was attracting an avalanche of investors.

    This concept exacerbates the impact of loses when the inevitable slump finally comes. The Kindleberger/Minsky model can, therefore, 
    be considered reflective of an indication that when the economy of a place seems to be doing extremely well and there is no logical explanation for the same, 
    it would be a bad idea to invest into it because a slump is imminent and inevitable. This begs the question of whether China could be going down this ignominious path and what this could mean for its future. 
    The most viable answer to this question should be an indefinite one. At first, the model as developed by Kindleberger relies very heavily on the unquantifiable factors of fear and greed.</p>
