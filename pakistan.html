He talked about forming a new nation by merging Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab and Afghanistan in the north-west of India. In 1933, Chaudhary Rahmat Ali, a student at Cambridge University, coined the term Pakstan (which later became Pakistan) for the people of Punjab, Sindh, Kashmir and Baluchistan . From 1947 to 1972, Pakistan was divided into two parts - East Pakistan and West Pakistan. As a result of war with India in December, 1971, East Pakistan became Bangladesh and West Pakistan remained Pakistan.
